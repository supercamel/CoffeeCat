<h1>CoffeeCat</h1>
<p>CoffeeCat is a programming language and a source-to-source compiler that produces C++. 
<h2>Why another programming language?</h2>
<p>CoffeeCat is a high level language for micro-controllers. 
Before CoffeeCat, if you wanted to program a micro-controller (such as an Arduino or STM32 board), you would probably need to use C or C++. 
These are great languages but C in particular can be a little tedious to develop with. 
<p>The CoffeeCat language is simple and convenient. It provides high-level abstraction and safety without adding any bloat. The CoffeeCat compiler is a trans-compiler that turns CoffeeCat into equivalent C++ code. 
This means the enormous wealth of C++ code that already exists can be used from CoffeeCat.
