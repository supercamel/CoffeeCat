<h1>CoffeeCat</h1>
<p>CoffeeCat is a programming language and a source-to-source compiler that produces C++. 
<h2>Why another programming language?</h2>
<p>CoffeeCat is a high level language for micro-controllers. 
Before CoffeeCat, if you wanted to program a micro-controller (such as an Arduino or STM32 board), you would probably need to use C or C++. 
These are great languages but they can be a little tedious to develop with. 
<p>The CoffeeCat language is simple and convenient. It has a Python-esque feel and provides high-level abstraction and safety without adding any bloat. The CoffeeCat compiler turns CoffeeCat into equivalent C++ code, so you have the simplicity of a high level language with the speed and efficiency of C++. 
<p>The compiler only produces a subset of C++. It does not use exceptions, nor does it use new/delete. Method access modifiers (public/protected/private) are also removed and all member methods and variables are made public. As they say in Python circles, "Simple is better than complex" and "We're all consenting adults here".
<p>CoffeeCat is completely interchangeable with C++. C++ code can create CoffeeCat classes and call CoffeeCat functions, and vice versa. This means the enormous wealth of C++ code out there can easily be used from CoffeeCat.
